    description: "Hidemasa Vincent Mitsui was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. As a kid, he enjoyed taking his toys apart to discover the inner workings of it, but never been able to put it back together. Ever since, he’s been dreaming that one day, he himself could become the person to be creating those toys. Today, Hidemasa is going through a rigorous Electrical Engineering (electro-physics track) curriculum at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. He is currently in his third year in college with bigger dreams than ever before. His current academic interest is in Electronic Device Engineering. He hopes to continue his research with the HND (Hawaii Nanoelectronics Device) Lab on graphene transistors until he graduates in the year 2019, and further his education to become a researcher. Outside of School, Hidemasa is always training to become a faster distance runner."
